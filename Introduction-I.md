### Operating System is a System Software

1) It is an intermediatory between hardware and User
2) It is a resource manager, and an allocator - manages system resources in an unbiased fashion for s/w & h/w
3) Provide platform for running other application.

    * It is a program, or a software for the very purpose to use hardware in a convinience, and efficient manner.\
    * Note: User -> OS -> Hardware

* All programs can interact only with OS

### Goals of Operating Systems

1) Primary Goals

        * Convenience - provides an interface to manage hardware
        * User Friendly

2) Secondary Goals

        * Efficiency: Minimum Input, maximum Output.
        Efficiency is not important, using it is important firsthand!
