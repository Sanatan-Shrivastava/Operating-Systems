### What is CPU Scheduling?
#### CPU scheduling is the method by which work is assigned to CPU that executes the process.

1. A process is composed of cycle of CPU and I/O operations.
2. CPU -> IO -> CPU -> IO -> CPU -> IO -> CPU
-a process starts with CPU and ends at CPU
3. IO Bound - process dependent more on external devices.
4. CPU Bound - process dependent more on CPU processes.
5. 
            Process
            /     \                     
        CPU bound I/O bound     => Good System

6. A good system has a good balance of CPU and IO bound processes.


**Since IO is user dependent, CPU bound processes are taken more into cosideration:**
