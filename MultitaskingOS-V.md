#### Multitasking Operating System:
**Time Sharing and Fair Sharing Operating System**

**One processor - Many Process - Context Switch**

**Context sharing is so fast in this OS that it seems that the processes seem to be running concurrently.**

**At a given Instance, Only one process is processed by a processor. Context Switching is really fast.**

1) Multitasking is MultiProgramming with Time Sharing. 
            
        "Multitasking is Extension of Multiprogramming."
2) Create threads of same program and perform context switch on these threads
3) Better processing time
4) Better Response time, and it seems as if multiple processes are running together.
