### Approaches of CPU Scheduling:

                Premptive   Non Premptive

1. When Process voluntarily leaves CPU, for another process after its execution, its called Non Pre-emption.
2. When Process is snatched from one process for another more priority process or when process is fixed to run for a fixed time interval, it is called Pre-emption.

3. This Fixed time interval is called Time Quanta.After a particular time quanta, after the quanta is expire, process context switch is performed. Server CPU outlooks this over clients.

4. More priority may include any external device IO bound process.

5. There are few criterias on which we decide which scheduling algos work better.
